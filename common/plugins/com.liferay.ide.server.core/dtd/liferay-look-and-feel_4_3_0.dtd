<!--
The look-and-feel element is the root of the deployment descriptor for
a Liferay look and feel archive. The look and feel archive will hereafter
be referred to as a LAF archive.
-->
<!ELEMENT look-and-feel (compatibility, company-limit?, group-limit?, theme*)>

<!--
The compatibility element specifies a list of Liferay Portal versions that will
properly deploy the themes in this LAF archive.
-->
<!ELEMENT compatibility (version+)>

<!--
The version element specifies a specific Liferay Portal version number. For
example, if its value is "3.5.0", that means the themes in this LAF archive will
deploy correctly in Liferay Portal 3.5.0. The portal will not deploy themes from
a LAF archive unless the version numbers match.
-->
<!ELEMENT version (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The company-limit element specifies a list of company ids that can access the
themes in this LAF archive. If company-limit is not set, then every company in
the portal has access to all of the themes in this LAF archive. If company-limit
is set, then the company ids will be included or excluded based on the
company-includes and company-excludes elements. If there is a disagreement
between company-includes and company-excludes, company-excludes takes
precedence.
-->
<!ELEMENT company-limit (company-includes?, company-excludes?)>

<!--
The company-includes element specifies a list of company ids that will have
access to the themes in this LAF archive.
-->
<!ELEMENT company-includes (company-id*)>

<!--
The company-excludes element specifies a list of company ids that will not have
access to the themes in this LAF archive.
-->
<!ELEMENT company-excludes (company-id*)>

<!--
The company-id element must have either the name or pattern attributes
specified. If the name attribute is specified, then the exact company id is
either included or excluded, depending on whether the company-id element is
inside the company-includes element or company-excludes element. If the pattern
attribute is specified, then a regular expression match is applied to the
pattern which will determine whether a company id is included or excluded.

<!--
The group-limit element specifies a list of group ids that can access the themes
in this LAF archive. If group-limit is not set, then every group in the portal
has access to all of the themes in this LAF archive. If group-limit is set, then
the group ids will be included or excluded based on the group-includes and
group-excludes elements. If there is a disagreement between group-includes and
group-excludes, group-excludes takes precedence.

<!--
The group-id element must have either the name or pattern attributes specified.
If the name attribute is specified, then the exact group id is either included
or excluded, depending on whether the group-id element is inside the
group-includes element or group-excludes element. If the pattern attribute is
specified, then a regular expression match is applied to the pattern which will
determine whether a group id is included or excluded.

The theme element contains the declarative data of a theme.
-->
<!ELEMENT theme (root-path?, templates-path?, css-path?, images-path?,
javascript-path?, virtual-path?, template-extension?, settings?, wap-theme?,
roles?, color-scheme*, layout-templates?)>

<!--
The id attribute specifies the unique key for a theme. For convenience, the id
attribute can be referenced in the rest of the theme element as ${theme-id}.

The name attribute specifies the friendly name of a theme that is displayed to
the user.
-->
<!ATTLIST theme
	id CDATA #REQUIRED
	name CDATA #REQUIRED
>

<!--
The root-path value sets the location of the root path for the theme. For
example, the root path for the Classic theme is "/html/themes/classic". This
means you can find the files for the Classic theme in
/docroot/html/themes/classic.

For convenience, the root-path attribute can be referenced in the rest of the
theme element as ${root-path}.

The default value is "/".
-->
<!ELEMENT root-path (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The templates-path value sets the location of the templates path for the theme.
For example, the templates path for the Classic theme is
"/html/themes/classic/templates". This means you can find the JSP or VM
templates for the Classic theme in /docroot/html/themes/classic/templates.

For convenience, the templates-path attribute can be referenced in the rest of
the theme element as ${templates-path}.

The default value is "${root-path}/templates".
-->
<!ELEMENT templates-path (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The css-path value sets the location of the css path for the theme. For example,
the css path for the Classic theme is "/html/themes/classic/css". This means you
can find css for the Classic theme in /docroot/html/themes/classic/css.

For convenience, the css-path attribute can be referenced in the rest of the
theme element as ${css-path}.

The default value is "${root-path}/css".
-->
<!ELEMENT css-path (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The images-path value sets the location of the images path for the theme. For
example, the images path for the Classic theme is "/html/themes/classic/images".
This means you can find images for the Classic theme in
/docroot/html/themes/classic/images.

For convenience, the images-path attribute can be referenced in the rest of the
theme element as ${images-path}.

The default value is "${root-path}/images".
-->
<!ELEMENT images-path (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The javascript-path value sets the location of the JavaScript path for the
theme. For example, the JavaScript path for the Classic theme is
"/html/themes/classic/javascript". This means you can find JavaScript for the
Classic theme in /docroot/html/themes/classic/javascript.

For convenience, the javascript-path attribute can be referenced in the rest of
the theme element as ${javascript-path}.

The default value is "${root-path}/javascript".
-->
<!ELEMENT javascript-path (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The virtual-path value sets the virtual path used to fetch the CSS, images, and
JavaScript files. By default, the portal returns the theme's servlet path. This
setting allows you to override it.

For example, suppose your theme is deployed to the servlet path "/test-theme"
and your theme image-path is "/xyz/images". By default, the portal will return
"/test-theme/xyz/images" for the path of the theme's images. You can override it
by setting virtual-path to "/virtual" and have the portal return
"/virtual/xyz/images". This is useful when you want all static files to be
served by Apache for better performance.

The default value is "" which means this is not used.
-->
<!ELEMENT virtual-path (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The templates-extension value sets the file extension of the files located in
the templates directory. If you specify the value "jsp", then the portal will
look for files such as portal_nav.jsp in the templates directory. If you specify
the value "vm", then the portal will look for files such as portal_nav.vm in the
templates directory. Specifying "vm" means you can use Velocity to create your
theme. New extensions will be supported in the future to allow for even more
flexibility in the creation of themes.

The default value is "vm".
-->
<!ELEMENT template-extension (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The settings element contain a list of settings or properties that are available
to the theme object at runtime. They are described with a key value pair.

For example, you can access it with the command: theme.getSetting("hello").
-->
<!ELEMENT settings (setting*)>

<!--
See the comments in the settings element.
-->
<!ELEMENT setting (#PCDATA)>

<!--

<!--
Set the wap-theme value to true if the theme is designed for cellular phones or
other mobile devices. The default value is false.
-->
<!ELEMENT wap-theme (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The roles element contains a list of role names. Users which have any of these
roles will be able to use this theme for their layouts and layout sets. Anyone
can use this theme if no role names are set.
-->
<!ELEMENT roles (role-name)>

<!--
The role-name designates the name of a security role.
-->
<!ELEMENT role-name (#PCDATA)>

<!--
A theme can have many color schemes. It works very similar to Windows. The
Windows XP theme has one set of color schemes, and the Windows Classic theme
has another set of color schemes. Each color scheme references a css class name
and defines an image path for the location of the color scheme's images.
-->
<!ELEMENT color-scheme (default-cs?, css-class, color-scheme-images-path?)>

<!--
The id attribute specifies the key for a color scheme that is unique for its
parent theme. For convenience, the id attribute can be referenced in the rest of
the color-scheme element as ${color-scheme-id}.

The name attribute specifies the friendly name of a color scheme
that is displayed to the user.
-->
<!ATTLIST color-scheme
	id CDATA #REQUIRED

<!ELEMENT default-cs (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The css-class value is a css class name that represents the color scheme.

For convenience, the css-class attribute can be referenced in the rest of the
color-scheme element as ${css-class}.
-->
<!ELEMENT css-class (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The color-scheme-images-path value sets the location of the images path for the
color scheme.

For convenience, the color-scheme-images-path attribute can be referenced in the
