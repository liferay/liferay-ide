and have the portal return "/virtual" for the servlet context path.

Set the preferences-company-wide value to true if the preferences for the

Set the facebook-integration value to either "fbml" or "iframe". The default
value is "iframe" because IFrame integration will work without requiring any
changes to your code. See the Message Boards portlet for minor changes that were
made to make it FBML compliant. Note that the Liferay tag libraries already
output FBML automatically if a request is made by Facebook.

If the add-default-resource value is set to false and the portlet does not
belong to the page but has been dynamically added, then the user will not have
permissions to view the portlet. If the add-default-resource value is set to
true, the default portlet resources and permissions are added to the page, and
the user can then view the portlet. This is useful (and necessary) for portlets
that need to be dynamically added to a page. However, to prevent security loop
holes, the default value is false.

The properties "portlet.add.default.resource.check.enabled" and
"portlet.add.default.resource.check.whitelist" in portal.properties allow
security checks to be configured around this behavior.

Set the system value to true if the portlet is a system portlet that a user
cannot manually add to their page. The default value is false.

Set the active value to true if the portlet is active and available to users.
If set to false, the portlet will not be active or available to users. The
default value is true.

This value can be changed at runtime via the Admin portlet.

<!--
Set the include value to true to if the portlet is available to the portal. If
set to false, the portlet is not available to the portal. The default value is
true.

Portlets that are not included as part of the portal are never available to the
user to be made active or inactive. As far the user knows, the portlets do not
even exist in the system. This allows the Liferay developers to bundle a lot of
portlets in one core package, and yet allow custom deployments to turn on or off
individual portlets or sets of portlets. This follows the Siebel and Microsoft
model of bundling everything in one core package, but using XML configuration or
registry settings to turn on and off features or sets of features.

We do not recommend that custom deployers modify the core source by removing
specific portlets because this prevents an easy upgrade process in the future.
The best way to turn on and off portlets is to set the include element. The
advantage of this way of doing things is that it becomes very easy to deploy
Liferay. All features are available in one package. The disadvantage is that by
not utilizing all of the portlets, you are wasting disk space and may even take
a small but static memory footprint. However, we feel that the extra disk space
and memory usage is a cheap price to pay in order to provide an easy
installation and upgrade path.

The role-mapper contains two names specified by role-name and role-link. The
role-name value must be a role specified in portlet.xml. The role-link value
must be the name of a Liferay role that exists in the database. The role-mapper
element pairs up these two values to map roles from portlet.xml to roles in
the Liferay database.

This is needed because Liferay roles may contain spaces whereas roles in
portlet.xml cannot contain spaces. This also adds extra flexibility where the
portlet vendor does not need to have any knowledge about Liferay's roles.
