The virtual-path value sets the virtual path used to override the default
servlet context path.

For example, suppose your portlet is deployed to the servlet path
"/test-portlet". By default, the portal will return "/test-portlet" for the
servlet context path. You can override it by setting virtual-path to "/virtual"
and have the portal return "/virtual" for the servlet context path.

The default value is "" which means this is not used.

Suppose the struts-path value is "mail". This tells the portal that all
requests with the path mail/* are considered part of this portlet's scope. Users
who request paths that match mail/* will only be granted access if they also
have access to this portlet. This is true for both portlet requests and regular
servlet requests.

Set the preferences-company-wide value to true if the preferences for the
portlet are across the entire company. Setting this value to true means
the value for preferences-unique-per-layout and preferences-owned-by-group are
not used. The default value is false.

For example, an administrator could set the preferences to an Announcements
portlet that would save a message in the portlet's preferences. This message
would then be used across all pages for that company. The portlet must not be
instanceable because instanceable portlets have uniquely generated portlet ids.

The default behavior of the bundled Announcements portlet sets the instanceable
value to true so that normal users cannot create company wide messages. A future
release would include permissions for the edit mode versus the view mode which
would allow an administrator to set the message while users would just view the
message.

<!ELEMENT preferences-company-wide (#PCDATA)>

<!--
Set the preferences-unique-per-layout value to true if the preferences for the
portlet are unique across all pages. If set to false, the preferences for the
portlet are shared across all pages. The default value is true.

preferences-owned-by-group element. See the comments for the
preferences-owned-by-group element for more information.

Set the preferences-owned-by-group value to true if the preferences for the
portlet are owned by the group when the portlet is shown in a group page. If
set to false, the preferences are owned by the user at all times. The default
value is true.

Suppose the Stocks portlet has preferences-unique-per-layout set to true and
preferences-owned-by-group set to false. Users can set a different list of
stocks for every personal page. Users can set a different list of stocks for
every community page.

Suppose the Stocks portlet has preferences-unique-per-layout set to false and
preferences-owned-by-group set to false. Users can set one list of stocks to be
shared across all personal pages. Users can set one list of stocks to be shared
across a community's set of pages.

Suppose the Stocks portlet has preferences-unique-per-layout set to true and
preferences-owned-by-group set to true. Users can set a different list of stocks
for every personal page. Administrators set the portlet preferences for users in
a community page. Administrators can set a different list of stocks for every
community page that are then shared by all users within a community.

Set the use-default-template value to true if the portlet uses the default
template to decorate and wrap content. Setting this to false allows the
developer to own and maintain the portlet's entire outputted content. The
default value is true.

The most common use of this is if you want the portlet to look different from
the other portlets or if you want the portlet to not have borders around the
outputted content.

Set the show-portlet-access-denied value to true if users are shown the portlet

Set the restore-current-view value to true if the portlet restores to the

Set the user-principal-strategy value to either "userId" or "screenName".
Calling request.getRemoteUser() will normally return the user id. However, some
portlets may need the user principal returned to be screen name instead.

<!ELEMENT user-principal-strategy (#PCDATA)>

<!--
Set the private-request-attributes value to true if the portlet does not share
request attributes with the portal or any other portlet. The default value is
true. The property "request.shared.attributes" in portal.properties specifies
which request attributes are shared even when the private-request-attributes
value is true.

<!ELEMENT private-request-attributes (#PCDATA)>

<!--
Set the private-session-attributes value to true if the portlet does not share
session attributes with the portal. The default value is true. The property
"session.shared.attributes" in portal.properties specifies which session
attributes are shared even when the private-session-attributes value is true.

<!--
The default value of render-weight is 1. If set to a value less than 1, the
portlet is rendered in parallel. If set to a value of 1 or greater, then the
portlet is rendered serially. Portlets with a greater render weight have greater
priority and will be rendered before portlets with a lower render weight.

If the ajaxable value is set to false, then render-weight is always set to 1
if it is set to a value less than 1. This means ajaxable can override
render-weight if ajaxable is set to false.

Set the facebook-integration value to either "fbml" or "iframe". The default
value is "iframe" because IFrame integration will work without requiring any
changes to your code. See the Message Boards portlet for minor changes that were
made to make it FBML compliant. Note that the Liferay tag libraries already
output FBML automatically if a request is made by Facebook.

If the add-default-resource value is set to false, and the portlet does not
belong to the page but has been dynamically added, then the user will see that
he does not have permissions to view the portlet. If the add-default-resource
value is set to true, the default portlet resources and permissions are added to
the page. The user can then view the portlet. Most portlets are harmless and can
benefit from this flexibility. However, to prevent security loop holes, the
default value is false.

The properties "portlet.add.default.resource.check.enabled" and
"portlet.add.default.resource.check.whitelist" in portal.properties allow
security checks to be configured around this behavior.

default value is true.

<!ELEMENT active (#PCDATA)>

<!--
Set the include value to true to if the portlet is available to the portal. If
set to false, the portlet is not available to the portal. The default value is
true.

Portlets that are not included as part of the portal are never available to the
user to be made active or inactive. As far the user knows, the portlets do not
even exist in the system. This allows the Liferay developers to bundle a lot of
portlets in one core package, and yet allow custom deployments to turn on or off
individual portlets or sets of portlets. This follows the Siebel and Microsoft
model of bundling everything in one core package, but using XML configuration or
registry settings to turn on and off features or sets of features.

We do not recommend that custom deployers modify the core source by removing
specific portlets because this prevents an easy upgrade process in the future.
The best way to turn on and off portlets is to set the include element. The
advantage of this way of doing things is that it becomes very easy to deploy
Liferay. All features are available in one package. The disadvantage is that by
not utilizing all of the portlets, you are wasting disk space and may even take
a small but static memory footprint. However, we feel that the extra disk space
and memory usage is a cheap price to pay in order to provide an easy
installation and upgrade path.

<!--
The role-mapper contains two names specified by role-name and role-link. The
role-name value must be a role specified in portlet.xml. The role-link value
must be the name of a Liferay role that exists in the database. The role-mapper
element pairs up these two values to map roles from portlet.xml to roles in
the Liferay database.

This is needed because Liferay roles may contain spaces whereas roles in
portlet.xml cannot contain spaces. This also adds extra flexibility where the
portlet vendor does not need to have any knowledge about Liferay's roles.
