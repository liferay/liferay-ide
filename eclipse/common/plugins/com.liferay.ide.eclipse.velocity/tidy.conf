# This file is the default tidy configuration file
# /etc/tidy.conf

# tidy - validate, correct, and pretty-print HTML files
# see: man 1 tidy

# tidy-mark: bool 
#	If set to yes (the default) Tidy will add a meta element to the
#	document head to indicate that the document has been tidied. To
#	suppress this, set tidy-mark to no. Tidy won't add a meta element
#	if one is already present. 
tidy-mark: no

# markup: bool 
#	Determines whether Tidy generates a pretty printed version of the
#	markup. Bool values are either yes or no. Note that Tidy won't
#	generate a pretty printed version if it finds unknown tags, or
#	missing trailing quotes on attribute values, or missing trailing '>' on
#	tags. The default is yes. 

# wrap: number 
#	Sets the right margin for line wrapping. Tidy tries to wrap lines so
#	that they do not exceed this length. The default is 66. Set wrap to
#	zero if you want to disable line wrapping. 

# wrap-attributes: bool 
#	If set to yes, attribute values may be wrapped across lines for
#	easier editing. The default is no. This option can be set
#	independently of wrap-scriptlets 

# wrap-script-literals: bool 
#	If set to yes, this allows lines to be wrapped within string literals
#	that appear in script attributes. The default is no. The example
#	shows how Tidy wraps a really really long script string literal
#	inserting a backslash character before the linebreak: 

#	<a href="somewhere.html" onmouseover="document.status = '...some \
#	really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, \
#	really, really long string..';">test</a>

# wrap-sections: bool
#	wrap within <![ ... ]> section tags. The default is yes.

# wrap-asp: bool 
#	If set to no, this prevents lines from being wrapped within ASP
#	pseudo elements, which look like: <% ... %>. The default is yes. 

# wrap-jste: bool 
#	If set to no, this prevents lines from being wrapped within JSTE
#	pseudo elements, which look like: <# ... #>. The default is yes. 

# wrap-php: bool 
#	If set to no, this prevents lines from being wrapped within PHP
#	pseudo elements. The default is yes. 

# literal-attributes: bool 
#	If set to yes, this ensures that whitespace characters within
#	attribute values are passed through unchanged. The default is no.

# tab-size: number 
#	Sets the number of columns between successive tab stops. The
#	default is 4. It is used to map tabs to spaces when reading files.
#	Tidy never outputs files with tabs. 

# indent: no, yes or auto 
#	If set to yes, Tidy will indent block-level tags. The default is no. If
#	set to auto Tidy will decide whether or not to indent the content of
#	tags such as title, h1-h6, li, td, th, or p depending on whether or
#	not the content includes a block-level element. You are advised
#	to avoid setting indent to yes as this can expose layout bugs in
#	some browsers. 
indent: yes

# indent-spaces: number 
#	Sets the number of spaces to indent content when indentation is
#	enabled. The default is 2 spaces. 

# indent-attributes: bool 
#	If set to yes, each attribute will begin on a new line. The default is
#	no. 
indent-attributes: yes

# hide-endtags: bool 
#	If set to yes, optional end-tags will be omitted when generating
#	the pretty printed markup. This option is ignored if you are
#	outputting to XML. The default is no. 

# input-xml: bool 
#	If set to yes, Tidy will use the XML parser rather than the error
#	correcting HTML parser. The default is no. 

# output-xml: bool 
#	If set to yes, Tidy will use generate the pretty printed output
#	writing it as well-formed XML. Any entities not defined in XML 1.0
#	will be written as numeric entities to allow them to be parsed by
#	an XML parser. The tags and attributes will be in the case used in
#	the input document, regardless of other options. The default is no.

# add-xml-pi: bool 
# add-xml-decl: bool 
#	If set to yes, Tidy will add the XML declatation when outputting
#	XML or XHTML. The default is no. Note that if the input
#	document includes an <?xml?> declaration then it will appear in
#	the output independent of the value of this option. 

# output-xhtml: bool 
#	If set to yes, Tidy will generate the pretty printed output writing it
#	as extensible HTML. The default is no. This option causes Tidy to
#	set the doctype and default namespace as appropriate to
#	XHTML. If a doctype or namespace is given they will checked for
#	consistency with the content of the document. In the case of an
#	inconsistency, the corrected values will appear in the output. For
#	XHTML, entities can be written as named or numeric entities
#	according to the value of the "numeric-entities" property. The tags
#	and attributes will be output in the case used in the input
#	document, regardless of other options. 
output-xhtml: yes

# doctype: omit, auto, strict, loose or <fpi> 
#	This property controls the doctype declaration generated by Tidy.
#	If set to omit the output file won't contain a doctype declaration. If
#	set to auto (the default) Tidy will use an educated guess based
#	upon the contents of the document. If set to strict, Tidy will set the
#	doctype to the strict DTD. If set to loose, the doctype is set to the
#	loose (transitional) DTD. Alternatively, you can supply a string for
#	the formal public identifier (fpi) for example: 
doctype: strict

#	doctype: "-//ACME//DTD HTML 3.14159//EN"

#	If you specify the fpi for an XHTML document, Tidy will set the
#	system identifier to the empty string. Tidy leaves the document
#	type for generic XML documents unchanged. 

# char-encoding: raw, ascii, latin1, utf8 or iso2022 
#	Determines how Tidy interprets character streams. For ascii, Tidy
#	will accept Latin-1 character values, but will use entities for all
#	characters whose value > 127. For raw, Tidy will output values
#	above 127 without translating them into entities. For latin1
#	characters above 255 will be written as entities. For utf8, Tidy
#	assumes that both input and output is encoded as UTF-8. You
#	can use iso2022 for files encoded using the ISO2022 family of
#	encodings e.g. ISO 2022-JP. The default is ascii. 

# numeric-entities: bool 
#	Causes entities other than the basic XML 1.0 named entities to be
#	written in the numeric rather than the named entity form. The
#	default is no 

# quote-marks: bool 
#	If set to yes, this causes " characters to be written out as &quot;
#	as is preferred by some editing environments. The apostrophe
#	character ' is written out as &#39; since many web browsers don't
#	yet support &apos;. The default is no. 

# quote-nbsp: bool 
#	If set to yes, this causes non-breaking space characters to be
#	written out as entities, rather than as the Unicode character value
#	160 (decimal). The default is yes. 

# quote-ampersand: bool 
#	If set to yes, this causes unadorned & characters to be written out
#	as &amp;. The default is yes. 

# assume-xml-procins: bool 
#	If set to yes, this changes the parsing of processing instructions to
#	require ?> as the terminator rather than >. The default is no. This
#	option is automatically set if the input is in XML. 

# raw: bool
#	avoid mapping values > 127 to entities. The default is no.

# fix-backslash: bool 
#	If set to yes, this causes backslash characters "\" in URLs to be
#	replaced by forward slashes "/". The default is yes. 

# break-before-br: bool 
#	If set to yes, Tidy will output a line break before each <br>
#	element. The default is no. 

# uppercase-tags: bool 
#	Causes tag names to be output in upper case. The default is no
#	resulting in lowercase, except for XML input where the original
#	case is preserved. 

# uppercase-attributes: bool 
#	If set to yes attribute names are output in upper case. The default
#	is no resulting in lowercase, except for XML where the original
#	case is preserved. 

# word-2000: bool 
#	If set to yes, Tidy will go to great pains to strip out all the surplus
#	stuff Microsoft Word 2000 inserts when you save Word
#	documents as "Web pages". The default is no. Note that Tidy
#	doesn't yet know what to do with VML markup from Word, but in
#	future I hope to be able to map VML to SVG.

#	Microsoft has developed its own optional filter for exporting to
#	HTML, and the 2.0 version is much improved. You can download
#	the filter free from the Microsoft Office Update site. 

# clean: bool 
#	If set to yes, causes Tidy to strip out surplus presentational tags
#	and attributes replacing them by style rules and structural markup
#	as appropriate. It works well on the html saved from Microsoft
#	Office'97. The default is no. 

# logical-emphasis: bool 
#	If set to yes, causes Tidy to replace any occurrence of i by em
#	and any occurrence of b by strong. In both cases, the attributes
#	are preserved unchanged. The default is no. This option can now
#	be set independently of the clean and drop-font-tags options. 

# drop-empty-paras: bool 
#	If set to yes, empty paragraphs will be discarded. If set to no,
#	empty paragraphs are replaced by a pair of br elements as
#	HTML4 precludes empty paragraphs. The default is yes. 

# drop-font-tags: bool 
#	If set to yes together with the clean option (see above), Tidy will
#	discard font and center tags rather than creating the
#	corresponding style rules. The default is no. 

# enclose-text: bool 
#	If set to yes, this causes Tidy to enclose any text it finds in the
#	body element within a p element. This is useful when you want to
#	take an existing html file and use it with a style sheet. Any text at
#	the body level will screw up the margins, but wrap the text within
#	a p element and all is well! The default is no. 

# enclose-block-text: bool 
#	If set to yes, this causes Tidy to insert a p element to enclose any
#	text it finds in any element that allows mixed content for HTML
#	transitional but not HTML strict. The default is no. 

# fix-bad-comments: bool 
#	If set to yes, this causes Tidy to replace unexpected hyphens with
#	"=" characters when it comes across adjacent hyphens. The
#	default is yes. This option is provided for users of Cold Fusion
#	which uses the comment syntax: <!--- ---> 

# add-xml-space: bool 
#	If set to yes, this causes Tidy to add xml:space="preserve" to
#	elements such as pre, style and script when generating XML. This
#	is needed if the whitespace in such elements is to be parsed
#	appropriately without having access to the DTD. The default is
#	no. 

# alt-text: string 
#	This allows you to set the default alt text for img attributes. This
#	feature is dangerous as it suppresses further accessibility
#	warnings. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING YOUR
#	DOCUMENTS ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SEE
#	THE IMAGES!!! 

# write-back: bool 
#	If set to yes, Tidy will write back the tidied markup to the same file
#	it read from. The default is no. You are advised to keep copies of
#	important files before tidying them as on rare occasions the result
#	may not always be what you expect. 

# keep-time: bool 
#	If set to yes, Tidy won't alter the last modified time for files it
#	writes back to. The default is yes. This allows you to tidy files
#	without effecting which ones will be uploaded to the Web server
#	when using a tool such as 'SiteCopy'. Note that this feature may
#	not work on some platforms. 

# error-file: filename 
#	Writes errors and warnings to the named file rather than to stderr. 

# show-warnings: bool 
#	If set to no, warnings are suppressed. This can be useful when a
#	few errors are hidden in a flurry of warnings. The default is yes. 

# quiet: bool 
#	If set to yes, Tidy won't output the welcome message or the
#	summary of the numbers of errors and warnings. The default is
#	no. 

# gnu-emacs: bool 
#	If set to yes, Tidy changes the format for reporting errors and
#	warnings to a format that is more easily parsed by GNU Emacs.
#	The default is no. 

# split: bool 
#	If set to yes Tidy will use the input file to create a sequence of
#	slides, splitting the markup prior to each successive <h2>. You
#	can see an example of the results in a recent talk I made on
#	XHTML. The slides are written to "slide1.html", "slide2.html" etc.
#	The default is no. 

# slide-style: filename
#	The name of the style sheet for use with slides.

# new-empty-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 
#	Use this to declare new empty inline tags. The option takes a
#	space or comma separated list of tag names. Unless you declare
#	new tags, Tidy will refuse to generate a tidied file if the input
#	includes previously unknown tags. Remember to also declare
#	empty tags as either inline or blocklevel, see below. 

# new-inline-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 
#	Use this to declare new non-empty inline tags. The option takes a
#	space or comma separated list of tag names. Unless you declare
#	new tags, Tidy will refuse to generate a tidied file if the input
#	includes previously unknown tags. 

# new-blocklevel-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 
#	Use this to declare new block-level tags. The option takes a
#	space or comma separated list of tag names. Unless you declare
#	new tags, Tidy will refuse to generate a tidied file if the input
#	includes previously unknown tags. Note you can't change the
#	content model for elements such as table, ul, ol and dl. This is
#	explained in more detail in the release notes. 

# new-pre-tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 
#	Use this to declare new tags that are to be processed in exactly
#	the same way as HTML's pre element. The option takes a space
#	or comma separated list of tag names. Unless you declare new
#	tags, Tidy will refuse to generate a tidied file if the input includes
#	previously unknown tags. Note you can't as yet add new CDATA
#	elements (similar to script).
